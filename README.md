# Task Log

This site is a simple set of buttons that I can use to log what tasks I've done that day. These are things I aim to do every day, for 20-30m. The status of the activity gets reset every day

## Usage:
Click on each task you've done in a given day. The button will stay pressed until the next day.
There will also be a log of what you did on past days.
